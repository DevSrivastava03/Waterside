            An interactive experience by the pier. Come and let your feelings flow... Whether you’re seeking solitude or connection, East river is a place to pause, reflect, and express. Sit by the water, listen to the soothing sound of the waves, and let your thoughts drift. Write a postcard to someone special, or even to your future self—express your emotions, memories, or hopes. The best part? It’s all anonymous. Your words become a part of the larger community—a collective expression of what it means to be human. No judgments, no expectations, just the freedom to be. Let the water carry your thoughts where they need to go.
